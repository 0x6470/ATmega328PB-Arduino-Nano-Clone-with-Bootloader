# ATmega328PB Nano Clone Bootloader
The bootloader is a modified version of Optiboot (https://github.com/Optiboot/optiboot).

## How to install
Add the following URL to the Arduino Board Manager (**File > Preferences > Additional Boards Manager URLs**)
```
https://github.com/dprinz4/ATmega328PB-Nano-Clone-with-Bootloader/raw/master/package_m328pb_index.json
